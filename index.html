Followed by the numeral four, explaining how many times the sheet has been divided from an A0-sheet. Then comes a hyphen which splits the word \u201CA4-sheet\u201D in two, but somehow keeps it together. \u201CArk\u201D \u2013 sheet in Swedish\u2013can indicate a chest, a ship or an abbreviation for the state of Arkansas, in this case means a rectangular piece of paper.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>COPYING MACHINE<br\/>\r\nToday I don\u2019t often see body parts or other three-dimensional objects copied on paper. Now there is the multi-function printer instead. With this machine I can scan, copy or print documents with a speed from five to hundreds of sheets per minute. But the higher the speed the higher the temperature. The Technical Research Institute can\u2019t give me an exact temperature, but the heat in a copying machine is between one hundred sixty and two hundred degrees celsius. This makes the fibres in the paper sheet swell a bit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you browse through A4-sheets printed on both sides in a copying machine or a printer you can hear a slight rustling sound when the text comes off from the adjacent pages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE MEASURMENT<br\/>\r\nA friend and I are standing in front of a glass exhibition case at the Mus\u00E9e des Arts et M\u00E9tiers in Paris. On the other side of the glass some of the oldest objects used to establish the meter and the kilogramme are exposed, long staffs or weighs made of brass and platinum.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>An A4-sheet is six hundred twenty-three point seven square centimetres. If I continue to draw lines across the sheet I can make three thousand eight hundred ninety-six squares fit into a sheet and each square corresponds to the measures of the sheet.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SOMETHING DESERTED<br\/>\r\nI hold the paper in my hand. It\u2019s smooth, thin, matt and fragile. If I smell it I can smell something deserted. The wood, chalk, clay, glue, water and air are deformed, pressed together in a seemingly lifeless setting. Like the zone criminals in Superman, locked up in a flat surface, condemned to exist in an indeterminate space.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper is white. I can almost, but not really see through it. When I hold it against the light I can see a marbled pattern. Sharp pain, blood on the edge of the paper, absorbed into the pores. The only way to stop the small, but deep, cut in the finger from bleeding is to use plaster. It is the chalk, clay and glue \u2013 that make the paper smooth \u2013 that stops the blood from being immediately soaked up into the paper.<\/p>'

          content: '<p>The definition of artistic activity occurs, first of all, in the field of distribution (Marcel Broodthaers quoted in Crow 1996, 177).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advent of the printing press, which placed exact duplication at the core of publishing, had the side effect of producing the concept of edition1. An edition of a book is \u201Cone of the differing forms in which a literary work (or a collection of works) is published, either by the author himself, or by subsequent editors\u201D. In terms of production, an edition of a work corresponds to \u201Cthe whole number of copies printed from the same set of types and issued at the same time\u201D (\u201CEdition\u201D 1989). The latter definition shows how such concept is inextricably connected to print as a technology. As Darnton (2007) suggests, it could be possible to trace all the different editions of a book in the form of a flowchart (cfr. 1.2.2). Through the concept of the edition, the idea of a separation between content and form starts to become apparent. In fact, an edition can differ from another one, not only in terms of content, but also in terms of the materiality of the support. A classic example lies in the work of Aldus Manutius who chose the handy octavo format to publish cultural milestones that, until then, were generally printed as intimidating folio editions (Bhaskar 2013, 112).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the advent of cheap and widespread duplicating technologies such as the hectograph or the mimeograph, the proliferation of diverse editions was mostly limited to successful or popular books that were not only officially reprinted in different formats, but also pirated, ripped off, sent as excerpts and finally offered as cheaper artifacts. Networked digital technology had an impact on the duplication, reconfiguration, and distribution of texts in terms of scale and speed. To get a glimpse of such impact, it\u2019s sufficient to consider that each time that a webpage is loaded by the browser, a copy of it on a local computer is made, thus the duplication cost of a text is close to zero. Similarly, digital networks have shaken the concept of edition: is every revision to a print on demand book to be considered a different edition? Shall every instance of text require its own ISBN code? The fluid threshold between version and edition touches upon the very concept of publication. In pre-digital publishing, the difference between version and edition lied in the state of a publication: a modified instance of a text that is not published would be a version of it, while a published one would be an edition. Networked digital media allow to revise a text after it was published, maintaining the same identification (permalink, ISBN, etc). Furthermore, daily tools like the copy and paste, common files formats, and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) simplify the process of copying a text or part of it, while reframing it in a peculiar environment. Such recontextualizations have also been automated: for instance RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) technology, first developed in 1999, allows to \u2018absorb\u2019 content from disparate sources and then organize it in a linear flow (Guha 1999). Likewise, the logic of reblog, first implemented as an open-source tool developed at the art and technology center Eyebeam2, allows, at the press of a button, to make an identical copy of the chosen content on an owned platform.<\/p>'

People go to nature looking for images such as these static things, whereas an apple is in fact a moment in the process from apple-seed to tree, blossom, fruit.\u201D \u2013 Bruno Munari \r\n(Design as Art, 1966)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1965, Italian artist and designer Bruno Munari created the Tetracono, a 15-cm black steel cube with four aluminum cones that spun at four distinct speeds on a 18-minute cycle. The product\u2019s function was to \u201Cshow forms while they are in the process of becoming.\u201D Applying Munari\u2019s ideology that \u201Cit is not research that should be purposeful, but its results,\u201D designer, educator, and publisher David Reinfurt recently spent six months as a fellow at the American Academy in Rome researching and experimenting with Munari\u2019s product-artwork, unsure of what might follow. Shortly upon his return to New York City, I spoke with Reinfurt about his research and how the Tetracono can act as a model for thinking through larger questions surrounding design, art, and the often grey areas in-between. Over the course of our many conversations, it became clear that Reinfurt\u2019s design research around the Tetracono is not close to finished. He explains, \u201CAs long as further digging continues to suggest new making, \r\nI will continue.\u201D Already, he has an event planned at the Picture Room in New York City and a lecture at MIT, among other projects.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARYN BEITZ (AB)<br\/>\r\nHi David. What initially lead you to the American Academy in Rome?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAVID REINFURT (DR)<br\/>\r\nI was ambiently aware of the American Academy in Rome since graduate school. Michael Rock (a teacher) was a fellow at the Academy and since then, I\u2019ve known several others. Six months living on the top of a hill in Rome with time, community, and, umm, food, as you might imagine, was compelling. It\u2019s also one of the only such prizes in design. The Academy is radically welcoming to families given that it *is* a residency fundamentally and partners are integrated into the communal life as \u201CFellow Travelers.\u201D Anyway, it was a tremendously long shot which just happened to work out. It is a gift that I will inevitably appreciate even more over time. Here are a few pictures of the studio, whose volume, as it turns out, was a perfect cube:<\/p>'
